This plugin offers 2 versions one [with](https://github.com/JustOptimize/return-ShowHiddenChannels/tree/With-Library) and one [without](https://github.com/JustOptimize/return-ShowHiddenChannels/tree/main) a custom library, at the moment the one without it requires a quick reload of the plugin every restart (I'm working on it), you are currently on the WITHOUT LIBRARY branch

# Return ShowHiddenChannels
<p align="left">
    <b>The return of the "banned" plugin ShowHiddenChannels.</b><br>
    A plugin which displays all hidden Channels, which can't be accessed due to Role Restrictions, this won't allow you to read them (impossible)
</p>

### The Story

On September 5th, 2022, Betterdiscord [announced](https://discord.com/channels/86004744966914048/178208945410801665/1016268576283426866) that plugins like ShowHiddenChannels would no longer be officially supported.

Additionally, the [plugin](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels) was discontinued and removed on the same day.

### Install (Without Library version)
- Download returnShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js from this repository
- Move it into the plugins folder
- Enable it
- Done

If you had the With Library version delete the library, the plugin (ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js), 1BDFDB.data.json, 1BDFDB.raw.css and 1BDFDB.config.json.

### Install (With Library)
- Follow the same steps
- Click download on the download prompt if you don't have the library
- Done

If you had the Without Library version remove that plugin

### Features

- Uses the original library

### TODO

- Find a way to patch the library (To add features)
- Add a DevTool toggleable setting (Instead of relying on the developer discord id)
