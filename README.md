# Return ShowHiddenChannels
<p align="left">
    <b>The return of the "banned" plugin ShowHiddenChannels.</b><br>
    A plugin which displays all hidden channels, which can't be accessed due to Role Restrictions, this won't allow you to read them (impossible)
</p>

### The Story

On September 5th, 2022, BetterDiscord [announced](https://discord.com/channels/86004744966914048/178208945410801665/1016268576283426866) that plugins like ShowHiddenChannels would no longer be officially supported.

Additionally, the [plugin](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ShowHiddenChannels) was discontinued and removed on the same day.

On September 26th, 2022, Discord has pushed out an absolutely massive change that completely restructured all of their internals and changed the functionality of countless modules. This has broken BetterDiscord itself and plugins completely.

On October 16th, 2022, I took it upon myself to fix the plugin and make it work again. I have no idea how long this will last, but I will try to keep it updated as long as I can.
### How to Install
- Download ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js by opening [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JustOptimize/return-ShowHiddenChannels/main/ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js) then right-clicking on that new page and clicking "Save As...".
- Move it into the plugins folder
- If you don't have the ZeresPluginLibrary it will prompt you to install it

In addition you can also use [this](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/PermissionsViewer) plugin by [@rauenzi](https://github.com/rauenzi/) to see the channel permissions/access.
