# ShowHiddenChannels

ShowHiddenChannels is a plugin for [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/) that allows users to view information about hidden channels in a Discord server, such as their name, description and which roles or users have access to these hidden channels.
**Please note that this plugin will not allow you to read the messages in these channels, it will only show you information about them.**

The original plugin by [@rauenzi](https://github.com/rauenzi/) was discontinued and removed from the official BetterDiscordAddons repository, so this plugin was created to fill that void.

If you are searching for the [Replugged](https://replugged.dev/) version of this plugin, there is one made by ["Nanakusa"](https://github.com/YofukashiNo) you can find it [here](https://github.com/YofukashiNo/ShowHiddenChannels).

## How to Install

-   Download this [file](https://github.com/JustOptimize/ShowHiddenChannels/releases/download/v0.5.0/ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js).
-   Move the downloaded ShowHiddenChannels.plugin.js file into your BetterDiscord plugins folder.
-   If you don't have the ZeresPluginLibrary installed, the plugin will prompt you to install it.
-   Enable both the ShowHiddenChannels plugin and the ZeresPluginLibrary.
-   Restart Discord to complete the installation.
-   Enjoy the plugin!

In addition, you can also use the [PermissionsViewer](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/PermissionsViewer) plugin by [@rauenzi](https://github.com/rauenzi/) to see the channel permissions/access.
